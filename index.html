					<p class="lead text-muted text-center">Despite the stigma associated with Dungeons &amp; Dragons when I played during the eighties, the introduction to RPGs greatly influenced my childhood socially and personally in very positive ways. I played the following games and the images you see represent the actual covers at the time. To this day, I still have them all including the character record sheets, dice and current modules in play the day I stopped playing over 30 years ago. I have very fond memories of that decade and RPGs played a huge part.</p>

					<p>The game that started it all!</p>
					<p>I was twelve years old and just beginning to play organized sports (basketball, baseball and football) which made me a late bloomer but my size and athletic ability outweighed my inexperience in the coaches eyes. I remember my brother (2 years older) coming home with these cool looking books that had great color and fantasy images on them. I was intrigued to say the least; I mean what little brother doesn't want to do what his big brother was doing, right?!</p>
					<p>I got my first taste of it at a friend's house while spending the night during summer break. He didn't know how to play and we just winged it for a bit before going outside to play. I wasn't hooked yet but it was coming...<a href="#" title="Under Construction"><em>view more.</em></a></p>

					<p>My time with D&amp;D Basic and Expert rules was short lived.</p>
					<p>After my initial introduction and subsequent play through a few modules, I jumped at the chance to move up to the big leagues at the same time as my brother. It worked out well as we could each buy separate books and share them. This was where I really got hooked and never looked back.</p>
					<p>I met my best friend around this timeand he had two brothers, an older brother that was a couple years older than us and a younger brother a couple years younger. Speaking with his older brother, I found we had a common interest in AD&amp;D. It didn't take long before we recruited the other two brothers and thus began a nearly five year journey into the world of RPGs that I will forever cherish along with the memories of an entire family that accepted me as one of their own...which was a good thing considering how much time I spent there...<a href="#" title="Under Construction"><em>view more.</em></a></p>

					<p>The 80's were great and with movies like Blade Runner, the Star Wars Trilogy, Aliens, Flash Gordon, Heavy Metal and The Ice Pirates it was only natural to gravitate in that direction.</p>
					<p>This was another instance of little brother picking up on what big brother had ventured into and just added another source of entertainment for me and my adopted family. New rules to learn, new characters and races, new environments to explore and the ability to mold your character's abilities based on how you wanted to spend your experience points. I think I enjoyed learning the rules and developing the characters and adventures as much as playing the actual game itself...<a href="#" title="Under Construction"><em>view more.</em></a></p>

					<p>I grew up just loving James Bond movies. Who wouldn't right?! The special gadgets, the secret missions, exoctic locations and best of all...the girls!</p>
					<p>When my brother brought this game home, it didn't take long before he and I scanned the rules and started playing the short mini-module included in the box. I made about a half-dozen characters afterwards in anticipation of taking the game to my adopted family's house and when I did we played the mini-module to introduce everyone to the game and then jumped right into <em>Operation Sprechenhaltstelle</em> that came with the original boxed set and provided replayability due to the open nature in it's design...<a href="#" title="Under Construction"><em>view more.</em></a></p>
